# Promise v/s Task

A humble repo to understand why JS `Promise` are even trickier than expected.
And how functional programming can help, and even provide a solution simpler than expected.

## Usage

### Locally on your machine

Clone, `nvm install`, then read and run each example.

### Using the TypeScript playground

TypeScript website has a convenient [playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play): you can copy-paste and run the code of each example directly over there.
