// Using `await` doesn't change a thing: 
// we can consider it pure syntactic sugar for `then`.
// Still, the word is kind-of misleading like `then`:
// if I'm await for something to happen, I can easily suppose
// that it happens while I wait, not necessarily that it 
// already happened.
//
// It's a bit more complex to show the behaviour.
